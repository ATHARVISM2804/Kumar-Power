		quote: `At Vilandl, we make bespoke Polki jewellery with the finest syndicate polkis, coloured gemstones and even finer details. We are extremely conscious about quality and create pieces that will be cherished for generations. We manufacture all of our jewellery pieces in-house and cater to both B2B and B2C clients. Recently, I referred Mr. R. S. Kumar from M/S Kumar Generator House to Mr Abhishek Jain of Jainco Sphere, a real estate company developing luxury homes in Delhi NCR. They had a detailed meeting and were really impressed with the knowledge and command he had on his industry. He suggested some important changes in their existing selection of material and design of LT panels and also, some value-added services which would enrich the experience of their customers. He was so convincing and transparent with his pricing and product detailing that Mr Abhishek gave an order for 2 of his under-construction buildings for Distribution panels, LT panels and chemical earthings. Also, the execution of work at the site was carried out with thorough professionalism and in a really time-bound manner. Mr Jain was very happy to work with M/s Kumar Generator House and highly recommends his services for Best quality, Best pricing and Best services.`,
